### 🎯 Overview

Led the **Telecom Monitoring market segment**, a strategic initiative aimed at expanding the company’s portfolio beyond traditional fiscal-control and traceability systems.  
The goal was to help governments **increase telecom-related tax revenue**, **reduce fraud**, and **improve market transparency** through digital oversight solutions.

The product line included several technology modules:
1. **Operator Revenue Monitoring** – Capturing Call Detail Records (CDRs) from mobile operators to compute real revenue and verify tax compliance.  
2. **Device Monitoring** – Identifying counterfeit or illegally imported mobile devices via a centralized Equipment Identity Register.  
3. **Mobile Money Monitoring** – Tracking mobile-money transactions to flag potential money-laundering or fraud cases.  
Additional opportunities were explored in **remittance** and **online gambling monitoring**, two rapidly growing sectors in Africa.
